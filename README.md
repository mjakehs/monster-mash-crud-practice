# monster-mash-crud-practice
This application is a simple crud scaffold using full stack javascript to allow users to interact with the database
from the DOM. The focus of this practice was to build out an efficient model/controller/route structure on the server,
which is why the user interface has been left plain and boring. This branch of the repository is a conversion of the master branch from jQuery to AngularJS, the backend code has been changed minimally.
 # dependancies
This appliation is dependant on AngularJS, node.js, express.js, body-parser module, mongoose module.
